# Final_project

* Topic: Direct Marketing

* Interested in predicting likelihood of subscribing to a term loan based on demographic data

* There are four datasets:
1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]
2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.
3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs).
4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs).
The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).

* The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.
